### Low-Level Design Document for Weather Application

This document provides a detailed low-level design of the Weather Application, including relevant UML diagrams to guide the development team.

#### 1. Introduction

The Weather Application consists of a backend service built with Spring Boot and a frontend interface built with React. This document includes class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and deployment diagrams to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's design.

#### 2. Class Diagram

The class diagram illustrates the structure of the backend service, including the main classes and their relationships.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class WeatherController {
        +getWeather(city: String): WeatherResponse
    }

    class WeatherService {
        +fetchWeather(city: String): WeatherResponse
    }

    class WeatherClient {
        +getWeatherData(city: String): WeatherData
    }

    class WeatherResponse {
        -temperature: double
        -humidity: double
        -description: String
    }

    class WeatherData {
        -temp: double
        -humidity: double
        -weatherDescription: String
    }

    WeatherController --> WeatherService
    WeatherService --> WeatherClient
    WeatherClient --> WeatherData
    WeatherService --> WeatherResponse
```

#### 3. Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram shows the interaction between the frontend and backend components when a user requests weather information.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ReactApp
    participant WeatherController
    participant WeatherService
    participant WeatherClient
    participant ExternalWeatherAPI

    User->>ReactApp: Enter city name
    ReactApp->>WeatherController: GET /weather?city={city}
    WeatherController->>WeatherService: fetchWeather(city)
    WeatherService->>WeatherClient: getWeatherData(city)
    WeatherClient->>ExternalWeatherAPI: Request weather data
    ExternalWeatherAPI-->>WeatherClient: Return weather data
    WeatherClient-->>WeatherService: Return WeatherData
    WeatherService-->>WeatherController: Return WeatherResponse
    WeatherController-->>ReactApp: Return WeatherResponse
    ReactApp-->>User: Display weather information
```

#### 4. Deployment Diagram

The deployment diagram illustrates the physical deployment of the application components on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph User
        A[Web Browser]
    end

    subgraph AKS Cluster
        B[React Pod]
        C[Spring Boot Pod]
    end

    subgraph External Services
        D[External Weather API]
    end

    A -->|HTTP Request| B
    B -->|API Request| C
    C -->|Fetches Data| D
    D -->|Returns Data| C
    C -->|API Response| B
    B -->|HTTP Response| A
```

#### 5. Component Diagram

The component diagram shows the organization and dependencies of the software components.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ReactApp {
        +index.html
        +App.js
        +WeatherComponent.js
        +WeatherService.js
    }

    class SpringBootApp {
        +WeatherController.java
        +WeatherService.java
        +WeatherClient.java
        +WeatherResponse.java
        +WeatherData.java
    }

    ReactApp --> SpringBootApp
    SpringBootApp --> ExternalWeatherAPI
```

#### 6. Detailed Class Descriptions

1. **WeatherController**: Handles HTTP requests from the frontend and delegates the processing to the WeatherService.
   - `getWeather(city: String): WeatherResponse`

2. **WeatherService**: Contains the business logic to fetch weather data from the WeatherClient and transform it into a WeatherResponse.
   - `fetchWeather(city: String): WeatherResponse`

3. **WeatherClient**: Interacts with the external weather API to fetch raw weather data.
   - `getWeatherData(city: String): WeatherData`

4. **WeatherResponse**: Represents the structured response sent back to the frontend.
   - `temperature: double`
   - `humidity: double`
   - `description: String`

5. **WeatherData**: Represents the raw data fetched from the external weather API.
   - `temp: double`
   - `humidity: double`
   - `weatherDescription: String`

#### 7. API Endpoints

1. **GET /weather?city={city}**: Fetches the current weather information for the specified city.
   - **Request Parameters**: `city` (String) - The name of the city.
   - **Response**: `WeatherResponse` - Contains temperature, humidity, and description.

#### 8. Conclusion

This low-level design document provides a detailed view of the Weather Application's architecture, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, deployment diagrams, and component diagrams. These diagrams and descriptionsprovide a comprehensive understanding of the system's design and should guide the development team in implementing the application.

#### 9. Additional Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the application gracefully handles errors, such as network issues or invalid city names, and provides meaningful error messages to the user.
2. **Security**: Implement security best practices, such as input validation, to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
3. **Testing**: Develop unit tests for the backend services and components, as well as end-to-end tests for the entire application to ensure reliability and correctness.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate logging and monitoring tools to track the application's performance and detect issues in real-time.

#### 10. Summary

This document outlines the low-level design of the Weather Application, providing detailed UML diagrams and descriptions of the system's components and interactions. By following this design, the development team can build a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly weather application.
